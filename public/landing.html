            <h1>Coding Experience</h1>
            <p>The first time I learned programming was in high school, it was a choice between C and Pascal,
                 I chose the latter one at the time. Although it was just elementary level of coding, I still 
                 found it fascinating to be able to automate stuffs in life with coding.
            </p>
            <p>In recent years, I picked up coding again by picking a very beginner-friendly language to start 
                with - Python. It is a very powerful language that has plenty of libraries and resources to use
                and I especially loved the ones that help monitor and auto-trade in the stocks and cryptocurrencies
                market.
            </p>
            <h1>Why do I enjoy coding?</h1>
            <p>I will write a very honest answer.</p>
            <h3><b>It's not just code:</b></h3>
            <p>Coding is not just typing some cryptic lines on the computer, it solves real world issues. I am able 
                to forward this content to my fellows only because coding has empowered us well to communicate in 
                an efficient way as human beings.
            </p>   
            <p>You can literally write code which can help people from the rural areas to order items from other 
                countries, accept payments, connect, share & collaborate. Coding has a lot to offer.
            </p>    
            <h3><b>Makes our lives easier:</b></h3>
            <p>Don’t want to drive in traffic, we have Uber.</p>    
            <p>Want to pre-book a villa, we have Airbnb.</p>    
            <p>Want to order food, we have plenty of apps for that as well.</p>    
            <p>and the list continues……………</p>    
            <p>Imagine if coding didn't exist, we wouldn't have any of these things.</p>    
            <h3><b>Age is not the bar:</b></h3>
            <p>People at any age can begin to code, there is no restrictions. Coding empowers even a teenage kid 
                who can now literally change not only his but our future as well.
            </p>
            <p>I can literally keep writing and still I won't be able to even cover half the reasons why I love 
                coding.
